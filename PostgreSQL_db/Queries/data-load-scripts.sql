--load monthly csv files into trips_raw is currently manually executed via "imports" into trips_raw table
--load weather and dates via manual "import"

--once trip_raw table is populated, the following scripts load data into 
--the data tables

--first, you must process the station data

--load start station data

--load end station data
INSERT INTO temp_stations (external_id, name, latitude, longitude)
SELECT DISTINCT
  end_station_id,

  NULLIF(ROUND(end_station_latitude, 6), 0),
  NULLIF(ROUND(end_station_longitude, 6), 0)
FROM trips_raw
WHERE end_station_id IS NOT NULL

--load distinct stations into stations table from the temp_stations
INSERT INTO stations (external_id, name, latitude, longitude)
SELECT DISTINCT
  external_id, 
  name, 
  latitude, 
  longitude
FROM temp_stations

--load trips table
